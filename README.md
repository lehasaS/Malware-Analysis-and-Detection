# Malware-Analysis-and-Detection

## Introduction
Malware research is a very dynamic field given the ever changing security landscape in the modern day. Security against malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, etc. requires continual improvement or even novel methods to improve the detection of such software. Several proposed mechanisms have been implemented, but often significantly lack automation capability. This has motivated researchers over the years to look into implementations leveraging areas of machine learning such as Deep learning. In this project, two convolutional neural networks were implemented to study their detection accuracy given differences in their depths and hyperparameters.

### Preliminary remarks
This repository contains live windows portable executable malware samples in the passowrd protected archive named samples.7z, the password is "infected". I will not be held liable for any damage that may occur from mishandling the samples. You have been warned! To extract the samples from the archive you can use the following command:

```
7z x samples.7z -pinfected
```
